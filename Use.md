# Use

Monomer can be executed via command line interface (CLI) or through visual interface.

## CLI
The command line interface can be used for [shell scripts](#Shell%20Scripts), executing a Monomer file via [interpreter](###Interpreter), or compiling a Monomer file

### Shell Scripts
To initiate a shell environment, enter the following into the command line.

    Mono shell

Additional options include

 - `-multiline` or `-ml` for several lines of shell script, to be executed at the entry of the character produced by typing *ctrl+Z*. This will also exit the shell environment immediately after.
 - `-file [file names]` or `-f [file names]` for starting the shell environment after executing the list of files. Any variables will be accessable in the shell.

### Interpreter
